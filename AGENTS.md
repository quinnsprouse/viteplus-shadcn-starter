Agent-ready starter kit: Vite+ + TanStack Start + React 19, with shadcn/ui (Base UI), Tailwind v4, and Nitro.

- Toolchain: `vp` (Vite+ CLI) — wraps Vite 8, oxlint, oxfmt, vitest, Rolldown
- Quality gate: `npm run check` (fmt + lint + typecheck + tests)
- Push gate: `npm run check:push` (check + build + dead code + Playwright e2e)
- CI gate: `npm run check:ci` (push + clean template journey + React Doctor + audit)
- React health: `npm run doctor` (react-doctor scan — security, performance, correctness, architecture; also runs on staged files at commit and in CI)
- React policy: use effects for external synchronization with complete dependencies and cleanup; derive values during render and handle user actions in handlers. Standard React lint rules enforce this where static analysis can.
- Lint policy: warnings fail, inline `oxlint-disable` / `eslint-disable` comments are errors; exceptions go in `lint.overrides` in `vite.config.ts` with a reason
- Fix the cause of a diagnostic; demonstrate a false positive with a minimal example before changing a rule or adding an exception. Prefer built-in rules and compiler checks over custom lint code.
- Dev: `npm run dev` (localhost:3000)
- Build: `npm run build`
- Hook recovery: `npm run setup` (after `git init`)

## Workflow

1. Plan — 2. Execute — 3. Test — 4. Commit

Put disposable experiments and generated inspection output in `.scratch/` or the OS temp directory, never the repository root.

## Commits

Conventional Commits enforced by commitlint. `type(scope): description`. No Co-Authored-By trailers.
