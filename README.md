# Rodeo 🤠

[Live demo](https://rodeo-quinnsprouses-projects.vercel.app)

A React starter for working with coding agents. Built on Vite+, TanStack Start, React 19, and Tailwind v4, with shadcn/ui configured for Base UI components. Includes Git hooks, tests, and agent docs.

Requires Node 24.11 or newer within Node 24, npm 11.12 or newer within npm 11, and Git 2.36 or newer.

## Quick start

```bash
npx degit quinnsprouse/rodeo my-app
cd my-app
git init --initial-branch=main
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Initialize Git before installation so Vite+ can install the hooks. If you install first, run `git init && npm run setup` afterward. Before the first push, install Chromium with `npm run test:e2e:install`.

## Customize

Update `src/config/site.ts` with the product identity and set `VITE_APP_URL` in production for canonical and social metadata. Leaving the URL unset omits origin-dependent tags.

Add UI components with the configured shadcn CLI. See [UI and motion](docs/agents/UI_MOTION.md) for component, styling, and icon conventions.

## Working with agents

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the entry point, with links to focused guides. `CLAUDE.md` links to the same file. [Lint rules](docs/agents/LINT_RULES.md) documents enforcement and how to handle false positives.

Claude Code hooks in `.claude/settings.json` check tool calls and provide formatting, lint, and type feedback after supported edits. Keep personal permissions in the ignored `.claude/settings.local.json`.

Optional skills are listed in `skills-lock.json`; restore them with `npm run setup:skills`. The normal install does not fetch skills.

## Layout
