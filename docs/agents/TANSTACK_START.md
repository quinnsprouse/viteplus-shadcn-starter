# TanStack Start Patterns

## Routing

- File-based routes in `src/routes/`. Export `Route` using `createFileRoute(...)`.
- Root layout: `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Never edit `src/routeTree.gen.ts`.
- Keep the full HTML document in the root route's `shellComponent` so loading, error, and not-found boundaries always render inside a valid shell.
- Colocate loaders/actions with route files unless there's a clear reuse boundary.
- Keep route params/search typing explicit through TanStack Router APIs.

## Server Functions

- Use `createServerFn` for server-only logic. Always `await` the call.
- A handler that reads `data` must declare `.validator(fn)` (or `.inputValidator(fn)`) first; `rodeo/server-fn-requires-validator` rejects unvalidated input at the boundary.
- Never pass non-serializable values (functions, class instances) across the server boundary.
- For data refresh after mutations: `router.invalidate()`.
- Retry loader failures with `router.invalidate()` so loaders rerun before the error boundary resets.

## Data Loading

- Prefer loaders for initial data — avoid client-side fetch waterfalls.
- Never fetch in `useEffect` what could be loaded in a route loader.
- Remember that route loaders are isomorphic. Move secrets and privileged work behind server functions or server-only modules.

## SSR

- Nitro handles the server engine (via `nitro/vite` plugin).
- TanStack Start SSR is automatic via `tanstackStart()` Vite plugin.
- Keep `verbatimModuleSyntax` disabled and import protection fatal so server-only code cannot leak into client bundles.
- Use `*.server.*` and `*.client.*` filenames (or the matching server-only/client-only markers) at environment boundaries.
- Production: `node .output/server/index.mjs`.
- Navigate with `useNavigate()` or `<Link>`, never `window.location` (`rodeo/no-window-navigation`).
- Never touch `window`, `document`, or storage at module scope; modules load on the server too (`rodeo/no-module-scope-browser-globals`).

## Full-stack example

The homepage demonstrates typed URL state, a route loader, a server function, and recovery from an error:

1. `src/routes/index.tsx` validates the `demo` search parameter and includes it in `loaderDeps` so it affects the loader cache key.
2. The loader awaits a private `createServerFn`; `src/lib/starter-status.ts` validates input and returns the result or throws.
3. The loader catches the requested `?demo=error` failure and returns a typed result for the route's recovery UI.

Keep shared logic in `src/lib/` and export only supported route symbols from route files. `src/lib/starter-status.test.ts` tests the shared logic; `e2e/smoke.spec.ts` tests the rendered result and error recovery. When adapting the example, put shareable state in the URL and test observable behavior through the same interface the route uses.
